# Reconstruction code 
# Author: Carole Hall

This reconstruction procedure utilizes molecular dynamics to estimate a high-resolution colony shape from low-resolution satellite imagery. This code was designed to be applied to data extracted from 30 meter-resolution Landsat satellite imagery showcasing penguin colonies in Antarctica, however I strongly believe this procedure would be applicable to other colonies or natural groups of objects in satellite imagery. 

The provided data for this procedure is a lower-resolution raster containing a 0-1 value in each pixel defining the area covered by an object of interest (in the case dealt with here, the object of interest is a penguin colony). We then populate each pixel's area with individual members of the greater object (in this case, individual penguin nests) according to the densities defined by the coverage area value. A molecular dynamics protocol is performed where boundaries are defined such that densities within each pixel area remain constant according to given data.

In the end, a higher-resolution shape is constructed. As the higher-resolution shape is defined by point data in this case, the concept of resolution is somewhat arbitrary. The finest possible resolution that can be achieved is then defined by the spatial occupancy of an invidual member of the object of interest. In this case, the highest possible resolution is the approximate spatial occupancy width of a single nest in a given colony. However, note that the provided procedure includes and uses a downsampling procedure wherein multiple nests are combined into a single `mega-nest' or pixel. In this case, the occupancy taken up by a single unit (in this case an area equivalent to multiple nests) is then taken as the minimum resolution.
