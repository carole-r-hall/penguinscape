# VHR annotations

Information on the extraction and resolution of these data can be found in the corresponding manuscript which will be published soon. These annotations were taken from very high resolution (VHR)
commercial satellite imagery over Ad√©lie penguin colonies, where each point represents the centroid of a pixel containing the colony. Generally these images were about 2-3 meter resolution but 
vary from image to image. The colonies included here are Cape Adar (ADAR), Berkley/Cameron Island (BERK), Brownson Island (BSON), Devil Island (DEVI), Inexpressible Island (INEX), and Possession 
Island (POSS). Within each appropriately named folder, one can find a shapefile (and four other necessary project files) corresponding to the annotation of that colony at high resolution.
