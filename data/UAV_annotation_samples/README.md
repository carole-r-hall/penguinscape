# UAV annotation sample data

Information on the resolution and retrieval of this data can be found in the corresponding manuscript which will be available soon. These data represent annotations taken from sub-meter-resolution
UAV images over Adélie penguin colonies in four locations within the Danger Islands: Beagle Island, Brash Island, Earle Island, and Heroina Island. In each appropriately named folder, one can find
shapefiles (and four other corresponding necessary project files) for ten 12 x 12 meter samples taken over flat, Adélie-only nesting areas at that location. Each point represents the approximate
coordinate of a nest centroid.
