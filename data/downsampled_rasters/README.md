# downsampled rasters 

The rasters contained herein are downsampled versions of the VHR annotations included in this repository. These data were downsampled to fit the 30 meter resolution of Landsat data to test our 
ability to recover the original high-resolution shapes from this downsampled data. These VHR annotations were downsampled in R using the disagg() function from the terra library.
