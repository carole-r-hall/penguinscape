# Colony radial distribution functions (RDFs)

The csv files here are distance (r) and averaged RDF value pairs for each of the four considered colony distributions: Beagle Island (BEAG), Brash Island (BRAS), Earle Island (EARL), and
Heroina Island (HERO). Each of these four RDFs were taken as an average over ten configurations found from annotations of sub-meter resolution drone imagery taken over Ad√©lie-only and mainly
flat areas of penguin colonies in the Danger Islands.
